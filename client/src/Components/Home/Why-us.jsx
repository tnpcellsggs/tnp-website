                <p>
                  Apart from being one of the best Technical Institute in
                  MARATHWADA and one of only a few in the MAHARASHTRA, SGGSIE&T
                  creates experiences that students cherish for their lifetime.
                  Whether the passion is with core branches or another
                  non-academic curriculum, the Institute is home to all of them.
                  The distinguished and renowned faculty at SGGSIE&T is among
                  one the best in MAHARASHTRA's vocational institutes. The
                  majority of the faculty members are high achievers in their
                  own right, as well as excellent teachers and mentors. "Most of
                  our professors are research scholars themselves and are deeply
                  involved in their subjects of interest," one student says.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is our professors' attitude that characterizes them and
                  makes them alluring to our students. The institute not only
                  has a bright set of students at all times, but it also has one
                  of the strongest and most loyal alumni networks, SGGSIE&T
                  alumni regularly contribute to enriching its experience. The
                  Institute encourages students to participate in several
                  extracurricular activities to ensure that students receive a
                  well-rounded education that is not limited to academic
                  achievements alone.

                  philosophy as well. Many SGGSIE&T students devote a
                  significant amount of time to their projects, which they
                  eventually turn into full-fledged businesses as soon as they
                  graduate from SGGSIE&T. TRAINING AND PLACEMENT CELL (T&P) is
                  housed at the institute, and it encourages students to think
                  for themselves. The research and incubation of technological
                  ideas that can be translated into entrepreneurial ventures are
                  supported by society. As a result, the institute provides a
                  conducive environment for new ideas to be generated,
                  researched, and nurtured before they become industry-ready.
