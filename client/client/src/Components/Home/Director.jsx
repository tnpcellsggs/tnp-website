                  <p>Greetings and a very warm welcome to SGGSIE&T!</p>
                  <p>
                    With a vision of education of human power for technological
                    excellence, Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of
                    Engineering and Technology stands as one of the prestigious
                    institutes in the state of Maharashtra. This institute
                    provides you with the opportunities to empower you with the
                    present technologies, with ever enthusiastic faculty to
                    familiarize the students with future technology trends.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The purpose of education is to transform proactive learners
                    into self-actualized learners. Students are encouraged to
                    harness their inquisitive skills with proactive learning,
                    soft skills which are required in all professions,
                    problem-solving skills along with programming languages to
                    equip our students to face the technological problems of the
                    future and imbibe Universal Human Values for sustainable
                    achievements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineering is about acquiring profound knowledge. A system
                    of profound knowledge consists of four parts appreciation of
                    the system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge
                    and psychology. We teach students the necessary tools for
                    grasping profound knowledge. We allow our students to
                    customize their learning experiences to their learning
                    styles within the academic framework of our institute.
                    Students can learn through various mechanisms such as
                    classrooms, MOOC courses, alumni associations, experts in
                    the industry, working in laboratories and various others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of our students are entrepreneurs who are ready to
                    support the start-up companies on campus. A significant
                    number of students pursue higher studies in India and
                    abroad. I would ask our students to take advantage of all
                    the opportunities and the tools to excel in this highly
                    competitive and fast advancing world. The Placement Office
                    (Internship Office) has been striving continuously to match
                    the students with their dream jobs (internships), resulting
                    in a win-win situation for the student and the hiring
                    organization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I look forward to the placement season 2022-23 and wish the
                    students all the best.
                  </p>
